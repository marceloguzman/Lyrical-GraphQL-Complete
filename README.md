# Lyrical-GraphQL Complete

This is the completed project from ["GraphQL with React: The Complete Developers Guide"](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-with-react-course/) by Stephen Grider on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com). 

### Notes

  - packages updated to avoid the $PushAll issue [(Github link)](https://github.com/StephenGrider/Lyrical-GraphQL/issues/17) 
  - Some extra CSS added to style the app
  - I made some changes to set all queries from the queries folder
  - Tidying up code using [prettier.io](https://prettier.io/)
